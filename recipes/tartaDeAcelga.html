        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class = "Description">
            This savory Swiss chard pie is a perfect combination of 
            tender greens, creamy ricotta, and a flaky, golden crust.
            It starts with fresh Swiss chard, which is sautéed with 
            onions and garlic to enhance its natural flavor. The 
            filling is enriched with eggs, grated cheese (like 
            Parmesan or Pecorino), and a touch of nutmeg for a warm, 
            earthy taste.
        </p>
        <p class = "Description">
            Encased in a buttery pastry crust, this pie is baked 
            to perfection, offering a satisfying blend of textures
            and flavors. Perfect as a main dish, appetizer, or 
            side, it’s a versatile dish that’s as nutritious as it is
            delicious!

            <li>Stir in the cooked Swiss chard mixture until well combined. Adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
