            <li>1 small red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooked rice (optional)</li>

            <li>1 cup tomato sauce (optional, for baking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class = "Steps">
            <li>Wash the zucchinis and cut them in half lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Scoop out the pulp with a spoon, leaving a thin shell to form a "boat."</li>
            <li>Chop the zucchini pulp and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Sauté the onion until translucent, about 3–4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in the bell pepper and chopped zucchini pulp, cooking until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the ground meat, breaking it apart, and cook until browned and fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Season with paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Optional: Stir in the cooked rice for a heartier filling</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Place the zucchini boats in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spoon the filling into each zucchini half, packing it tightly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the tops with Parmesan and mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Optional: Pour tomato sauce into the baking dish around the zucchinis for added moisture and flavor.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10–15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden.</li>

            <li>Serve warm, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.
